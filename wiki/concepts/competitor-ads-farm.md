# Competitor Ads Farm

## What it is

The third farm in this vault (after `ai-creators-youtube` and `x-monitor`) — automated daily ingest of competitor ads from Meta Ad Library via Apify's `facebook-ads-library-scraper` actor. Mirrors the [[concepts/context-farming]] pattern but for paid-creative intelligence rather than YouTube/X organic content.

Config lives at `farmers/competitor-ads.md`. State (seen ad IDs, capped 2000) at `farmers/state/competitor-ads.json`. Schedule: `0 6 * * *` (6 AM Pacific, 30 min after the YouTube farm to avoid wiki-lock contention).

## Two competitive sets

### Set 1 — AI consulting / 3Ps positioning

- **[[anthropic]]** — anchor brand
- **[[openai]]** — anchor brand
- **[[hampton-founders]]** — peer/adjacent founder community
- **DealMachine** — peer/adjacent

Feeds copy decisions for landing pages, Skool community pitch, sales pages.

### Set 2 — GLP-1 telehealth (Medvi competitive set)

- **[[hims]]** — primary benchmark (highest creative volume in 2026-05-06 batch — 45 ads)
- **[[ro]]** — direct competitor
- **Eden** — direct competitor (telehealth — *not* the gardening / bedding / fashion brands the bare-keyword search returns)
- **[[henry-meds]]** — direct competitor (compounded-first)

Feeds the Meta Ads agent's creative test backlog and Medvi positioning.

## Architecture (three phases)

Mirrors the YouTube farm:

1. **Phase 1 — Apify fetch** — pull active ads, dedup against state, write digest to `raw/ads/digest-{date}.{md,json}`, commit + push
2. **Phase 2 — Headless `claude -p /wiki-ingest`** — only fires if new-ad count > 0; creates/updates entity (brand) pages and concept pages, commits + pushes
3. **Phase 3 — Slack notify** — STUDY/NOTE/PASS verdict per ad with LLM 1-sentence summary

## Slack verdict scale

- **STUDY** — novel angle, hook, format, or claim worth tearing down for inspiration
- **NOTE** — useful reference but familiar pattern; file for context
- **PASS** — generic, recycled, dynamic-creative placeholders, FDA disclaimers only

Most days: NOTE or PASS dominate. STUDY is reserved for genuinely novel creative.

## First batch findings (2026-05-06)

From [[ads-digest-2026-05-06]]:

- **187 fetched / 183 new / 4 dedup-skipped** — first batch so dedup state was empty
- **[[hims]] is the volume leader** — 45 ads, three creative wedges (GLP-1, hair-loss "Hair Hybrids", Sex Rx), pioneered the [[concepts/compounded-drug-disclaimer]] and [[concepts/dtc-telehealth-ad-template]] patterns documented in this vault
- **AI labs ship dynamic-creative-only** — OpenAI (21 ads) and Anthropic (5) both run pure catalog/product-feed carousels with `{{product.name}}` headlines and `{{product.brand}}` bodies, zero static narrative
- **[[hampton-founders]] is the only "Hampton" with relevant creative** — vetted founder peer-group community for $3M+ revenue founders
- **Ro / Henry Meds / DealMachine produced ~zero relevant creative** — Ro had 1 placeholder; Henry Meds and DealMachine missing entirely

## Known issue: brand-name filter is too permissive

The farmer config promises a post-fetch filter that *"drops third-party ads that mention a brand keyword (e.g. random pages running ads about 'Hims hair loss'). Only ads where the page name contains the search brand are kept."*

The 2026-05-06 digest shows the filter **kept** ads from third-party pages whose **page name** contains the keyword as a substring — so:

- "Eden" matched **Eden Brothers** (gardening, 14 ads), **Eden & Om** (bamboo sheets, 13), **Aelfric Eden** (fashion), **UNC Health Rockingham at Eden NC**, etc. — none are the GLP-1-telehealth Eden
- "Hampton" matched dozens of regional businesses (Hampton Inn, Hampton Roads Honda, Hampton Roads Transit, Hampton Sun, Classic Toyota Hampton, etc.) — none are Hampton Founders
- "Ro" matched Roads & Kingdoms, Roseionly, Rockfest, ProTyres Oradea, Modlet.ro, dozens more — none are Roman Health

**Estimated noise rate: ~65% of digest entries.**

### Action items

- → tune the [[competitor-ads]] farm to use **exact page-name match** or **page-ID allow-listing** rather than substring match
- → for short brand names ("Ro", "Eden", "Hampton"), maintain an explicit allow-list of the actual FB Page IDs
- → consider adding `Roman Health`, `Ro Body`, `Hampton Founders`, `Eden Body` to the search-brand list to catch the variant page names

## Why this farm exists

Two specific products feed from it:

1. **Medvi compete-page work** — Hims/Ro/Henry Meds creative becomes the diff-target for Medvi positioning (price split, disclaimer language, wedge messaging, ad-template structure)
2. **Meta Ads agent project** — the wiki becomes a feature library the agent draws from when generating new Medvi creative

## Appears in

- [[sources/ads-digest-2026-05-06]] — first batch

## Open questions

- Will Ro / Henry Meds appear in next batches once the brand-name filter is tuned?
- What's the right cadence for Slack verdict review — every batch (manual), weekly digest (delegated), or per-STUDY-only (alert)?
- Should compounded GLP-1 mentions trigger a `> ⚠️ Compliance:` callout on the entity page automatically? (Currently manual.)
